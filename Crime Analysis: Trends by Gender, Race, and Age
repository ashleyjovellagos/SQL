# Crime Analysis SQL Project

This project explores crime trends based on gender, race, and age using SQLite. The data was analyzed using SQL queries and visualized with Tableau.

## 📊 Project Highlights
- Identified the most common types of crimes
- Analyzed average offender age by crime category
- Examined crime distribution by gender and race
- Prepared data for visualization in Tableau

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- SQL (SQLite)
- Tableau
- Git & GitHub

## 📁 SQL Queries Included
- `most_common_crimes.sql` – Frequency of each crime category
- `average_age_by_crime.sql` – Average offender age per crime
- `offender_race_distribution.sql` – Crime count by offender race
- `gender_based_crime_analysis.sql` – Crime trends for male and female offenders

## 📈 Visualization
The insights from these queries were used to build an interactive Tableau dashboard available [here]https://public.tableau.com/views/CrimeAnalysisTrendsbyGenderRaceandAge/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

#### 📝 Below are my SQL queries:  
```sql
--Most common types of crimes

SELECT Category, COUNT(*) as Crime_Count
from BIT_DB.Crime
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY Crime_Count DESC;

--What is the average age of an offender and what crime did they commit?

SELECT ROUND(AVG(offender_age),0) as offender_age, Category
FROM BIT_DB.Crime
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY offender_age desc;

--What is the population distribution of offenders race?

SELECT offender_race,COUNT(offender_race) as totals
FROM BIT_DB.Crime
GROUP BY offender_race
ORDER BY totals desc;

--What crimes did female offenders commit the most?
SELECT Category,COUNT(offender_gender)as female_count
FROM BIT_DB.Crime
WHERE offender_gender='FEMALE'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY female_count DESC;

--What crimes did male offenders commit the most?
SELECT category,COUNT(offender_gender)as male_count
FROM BIT_DB.Crime
WHERE offender_gender='MALE'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY male_count DESC;
